- Inside it: embedded autoplay/muted/loop demo video.

### SECTION 4 — FOOTER (UPDATED)
Footer must be minimal, centered, small.

Left side (small): Tiny Boundier wordmark + tagline (very small):
`You See It. We Read It.`

Center: Clean YouTube icon (simple SVG) linking to:
`https://youtube.com/@boundier`

Right side: Primary action button (glass-style / accent blue text):
`Email Us` → mailto:boundierofficial@gmail.com



Design notes:
- Footer text uses Cooper Hewitt Regular at small size.
- Icons and logo constrained to subtle size (max 24px height).
- Maintain liquid-glass aesthetic where appropriate (very subtle).
